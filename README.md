# WAVELET-BASED-MODIFIED-FUZZY-LOCAL-INFORMATION-C-MEANS-WITH-MINIMIZED-ENERGY-FUNCTION
This project presents a modification to a fuzzy based segmentation algorithm proposed by Krindis and Chatzis known as fuzzy local information c-means (FLICM) which has a variation of fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm. In project work, we have proposed a modification to energy function of FLICM.
